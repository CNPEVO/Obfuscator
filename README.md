# Obfuscator
Makes every python script fud against any AV.
It uses 3 stages to encrypt, different version of code every time, different delay and gets automated the imports of the scripts and add them to the output.
You put your code into in.py and run main.py, then you get the obfuscated code printed, now its fud.
